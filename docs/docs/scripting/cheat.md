# Dev Tools (Cheats)
Sapiens contains a few utillity tools to make modding easier (cheat), built automatically into the game. It is unknown if dave will remove these before launch!

:::warning
In latest versions, these cheat tools are not available without modifying the game. Check `scripts/common/gameConstants.lua`.

## Debug Menu

To access to the debug menu, you can select it from the settings tab:

It is suggested that you enabled the debug display checkbox, which will enable the two following additional displays.

### Debug Display

The debug display shows in the top right corner of your screen, and is similar to the `F3` view in games like Minecraft. It will show your FPS, currently queued order totals, among other useful debug information.

### Context Aware Debugging

The context aware debugger is a little "debug" button that will appear in the bottom left corner of your screen. It will allow you to perform a single "debug" action on the currently selected object.

**Note:** For most objects, the debug button will do nothing. Only specific contexts have any functionality.


## Lua Console

The Lua console can be summoned by pressing `c` to summon the chat window, then typing `/lua` to enter lua mode. This mode essentially allows you to execute lua code, although it does not store state between commands.

How to open console:

Once in lua mode, there are a few useful functions you might want to call:

### Spawn

 - Example: `spawn('mammoth')`
 - Description: Spawns the object if it exists, and places it at your feet.

### Instant Build Mode

 - Format: `completeCheat()`
 - Description: Enables instant build mode.
