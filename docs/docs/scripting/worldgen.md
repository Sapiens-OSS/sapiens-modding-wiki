# World Generation

World generation is split into multiple stages. A working understanding of C/C++ modding is required.

::: info
This page mentions the engine headers and code several times. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Majic-Jungle/splugins).
:::

## Common Objects

Common objects are used in more than one stage of world generation.

### SPWorldGenOptions

`SPWorldGenOptions` is used to pass settings from the GUI to the generation functions. It's used in `spHeightGet` for vertex height generation and `spRainfallGet` for rainfall generation. It's defined in `SPCommon.h`.

```cpp
struct SPWorldGenOptions {
	double heightOffset;
	double rainfallMultiplier;
	double temperatureOffset;
	SPVec3 scales;
	SPVec3 influences;
}
```

### SPNoise

`SPNoise` is part of the noise generation system. While the exact details are unknown (due to the close-source engine), it can be used to generate noise/random values.

#### spNoiseGet

This function allows you to sample the noise value at a specific location. It takes three arguments:

- `SPNoise* noise` An instance of `SPNoise`
- `SPVec3 vec` The point you want to sample
- `int endOctave` Sets the "detail" or frequency of your noise.

The two last arguments can be tweaked to get a desired result. Do not set `endOctave` too high (max ~8) as this increases the time it takes to sample noise values.

Here are four examples of using `spNoiseGet` to set terrain height on a certain position called `noiseLoc`:

```c
spNoiseGet(noise1, noiseLoc, 1) * 1000; // <- Creates a world with large oceans and large continents, while keeping the terrain relatively flat

spNoiseGet(noise1, noiseLoc, 8) * 1000; // <- Creates a world with more details: islands, lakes, etc. and continents and oceans are slightly smaller, but everything remains relatively flat

spNoiseGet(noise1, spVec3Mul(noiseLoc, 1000), 1) * 1000; // <- Creates a world consisting entirely of small, smooth and relatively flat islands

spNoiseGet(noise1, spVec3Mul(noiseLoc, 1000), 8) * 1000; // <- Creates a world consisting entirely of small but rugged islands
```

## Vertex Terrain Generation

Vertex Terrain generation determines the height of every point in the world. This height is represented in the [pre-render coordinate scale](/docs/engine/coordinates). The methods required for vertex generation are defined in `SPHeight.h`.

::: tip
You can convert meters into the prerender scale by using the `SP_METERS_TO_PRERENDER` macro:
```cpp
double heightInPrerenderScale = SP_METERS_TO_PRERENDER(heightInMeters);
```
:::

### Methods

The following methods can be overridden to implement custom vertex terrain generation.

#### spHeightGet

- `previousHeight: SPVec4` when `spReplacesPreviousHeight` returns false, then previousHeight is the output of the previous mod, otherwise it should be ignored
- `noise1: SPNoise*` An instance of a noise generator, can be used to get smooth noise values at a given point.
- `noise2: SPNoise*` An instance of a noise generator, can be used to get smooth noise values at a given point. Same as `noise1` but initialized with a different seed.
- `pointNormal: SPVec3` The normalized location on the planet , you can imagine it as sampling points on a sphere with `(0,0,0)` as the center and a radius of `1`.
- `noiseLoc: SPVec3` Position to sample noise values at, defined as `pointNormal + vec3(1.2, 1.2, 1.3)` as noise generation breaks down at coordinates `<=0`
- `worldGenOptions: SPWorldGenOptions` Options for the world generator, set in the UI when the user is generating a new world.
- `riverValue: double` Used as a crude height multiplier.
- `riverDistance: double` Distance to a nearby river if one is close enough.

::: tip
You can calculate the latitude and longitude as follows:

```cpp
    double lat = asin(pointNormal.y);

    double lon = 0;
    if (fabs(pointNormal.x) + fabs(pointNormal.z) > 0.0000001) {
        lon = atan2(pointNormal.z, pointNormal.x);
    }
```

:::

::: warning
Some points are `NaN`, the vanilla implementation returns `NaN` at these points. Returning anything else seems to cause artifacts on the equator of the planet.
:::

The return value from te function is a vector with 4 components. The first component is the height, the other components are currently unused and in the vanilla implementation always `riverDistance`, `0` and `0` respectively.

#### spReplacesPreviousHeight

This method has no arguments, when `true` is returned the output of the previous mod is ignored. If `false` is returned the output of the previous mod is passed to `spHeightGet`

### Example

Below is the code for the `FlatTerrainMod` which returns a height of 10 for every position in the world and generates a planet that has flat terrain.

```cpp
#include "SPHeight.h"

bool spReplacesPreviousHeight()
{
	return true;
}

//if spReplacesPreviousHeight returns false, then previousHeight is the output of the previous mod, otherwise it should be ignored.
SPVec4 spHeightGet(SPVec4 previousHeight, 
                   SPNoise* noise1,
                   SPNoise* noise2,
                   SPVec3 pointNormal,
                   SPVec3 noiseLoc,
                   SPWorldGenOptions worldGenOptions,
                   double riverValue,
                   double riverDistance) {


    SPVec4 result = {SP_METERS_TO_PRERENDER(10), riverDistance, 0.0, 0.0};
    return result;
}
```

## Biome and Climate assignment

Biomes are assigned in this stage of world generation, objects like trees and rocks are placed in this stage of generation.

### Objects

Objects that are common to multiple methods during biome generation.

#### SPBiomeThreadState

Allows the biome generator to get indices for various objects generated on the Lua side.

```cpp
struct SPBiomeThreadState {
	void* terrainGenerator; //private
	void* gom; //private

    // The following methods can be called to get the index from the lua typeMap for various types of objects.
	uint16_t (*getBiomeTag)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,char*); // Get the index for the given biome tag, eg "hot".
	uint32_t (*getTerrainBaseTypeIndex)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,char*); // Get the index for the given terrain base type, eg "riverSand"
	uint32_t (*getTerrainVariation)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,char*); // Get the index for the given terrain variation, eg "grassSnow"
	uint32_t (*getTerrainModification)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,char*); // Get the index for the given terrain modification, eg "preventGrassAndSnow"
	uint32_t (*getGameObjectTypeIndex)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,char*); // Get the index for the given object type, eg "appleTree". Note that this method can be null and has to be checked for existence

	uint32_t (*getMaterialTypeIndex)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,char*);
	uint32_t (*getDecalGroupTypeIndex)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,char*);

	SPSurfaceTypeDefault (*getSurfaceDefaultsForBaseType)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,uint32_t);
	SPSurfaceTypeDefault (*getSurfaceDefaultsForVariationType)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,uint32_t);

	uint32_t (*getSurfaceBaseTypeForFillObjectType)(struct SPBiomeThreadState*,uint32_t);

	SPRand* spRand;
	SPNoise* spNoise1;
	SPNoise* spNoise2;
}
```

### Methods

The following methods can be overridden to implement custom biome generation.

#### spBiomeInit

- `threadState: SPBiomeThreadState*`

This method has no return value, the method is used to initialize static variables with indices of the relevant object.

#### spBiomeGetTagsForPoint

It's currently unknown what this method exactly does. You can help by checking out the vanilla code!

#### spBiomeGetSurfaceTypeForPoint

Allows you to change the surface type on a certain location in the world. For example, you can change how frequent clay, rock, soil, or any other surface generates in the world. If you want to make clay surfaces more common for example, you can increase the chances of clay spawning by modifying this function. You can also use this to spawn your custom surface types into the world.

Note that this function does not spawn small rocks, boulders, clay balls or anything of that sort. This is merely concerned with the "ground" type that spawns.

- `SPBiomeThreadState* threadState` The state of the thread including noise generators and a RNG object.
- `SPSurfaceTypeResult incomingType` The type as generated by the vanilla code.
- `uint16_t* tags` The type of biome at the current location.
- `int tagCount` Amount of biomes.
- `uint32_t* modifications` Modifications such as if there is snow, or if the soil has vegetation on it or not.
- `int modificationCount` The amount of modification types.
- `uint32_t fillGameObjectTypeIndex` Not sure what this is.
- `int16_t digFillOffset` Not sure what this is.
- `uint32_t* variations` Terrain variations such as red rock, green rock, snow, etc.
- `SPVec3 pointNormal` Coordinates in the world.
- `SPVec3 noiseLoc` A noise value associated with that coordinate.
- `double baseAltitude` The altitude of the coordinate. There is no "absolute minimum" or "absolute maximum", but running some tests it seems to fall between -0.001 and 0.001, with 0 being the sea level. A value of 0.001 translates to about 4335. 1 meter translates to 0.00000023 units in baseAltitude
- `double steepness` The steepness of that coordinate. It is calculated by taking two other samples 4m away, one to the north, and one to the east, of which the maximum absolute difference between those heights and the base point height in meters is taken.
- `double riverDistance` Distance to the closest river. A river distance of 1 indicates that the nearest river is about 7650 hexagons away
- `int seasonIndex` What season it's in (?).

The return value is a `SPSurfaceTypeResult`. This struct contains the following:

- `uint32_t surfaceBaseType` The type of the surface, such as clay, rock, soil, etc.
- `uint16_t variationCount` Not sure what this is.
- `uint32_t materialIndex` The material (texture) that is associated with the surface type. Changing the surface type is therefore not sufficient, you need to manually set the correct material too.
- `uint32_t decalTypeIndex` Not sure what this is.
- `uint8_t pathDifficultyIndex` Sets the difficulty of traversing this surface.

::: tip
You can convert the steepness value into radians going from 0 to π/2 by doing:

```cpp
double angle = isnan(steepness) ? 0 : atan(steepness / sqrt(32));
```

:::

#### spBiomeGetTransientGameObjectTypesForFaceSubdivision

This method is responsible for spawning gameobjects, this ranges from rocks to trees. Adding gameobjects is done by adding the relevant index (acquired in `spBiomeInit`) the `types` array. It's your responsibility that you write to indices within the range `[incomingTypeCount, BIOME_MAX_GAME_OBJECT_COUNT_PER_SUBDIVISION)`.
Vanilla has a helper macro for this, it requires you to define an integer at the top of the method (`int addedCount = incomingTypeCount`):
Note that this method is called for all mods enabled (this includes vanilla!) and you can thus already have gameobjects in the `types` array. It's possible to overwrite previous mods by overwriting previous indices.

- `threadState SPBiomeThreadState*` The state of the thread including noise generators and a RNG object.
- `incomingTypeCount: int` Amount of already generated objects
- `types: uint32_t*` Array of types to be generated with size `BIOME_MAX_GAME_OBJECT_COUNT_PER_SUBDIVISION`.
- `biomeTags: uint16_t*`Array of biome tags at the position to generate.
- `tagCount: int` Amount of biome tags at the position to generate
- `pointNormal: SPVec3`
- `noiseLoc: SPVec3` Location to be used in conjunction with the given noiseGenerator.
- `faceUniqueID: uint64_t` The unique id of the face, can be used to get random values.
- `level: int` The level of subdivisions the face has undergone. The higher this value, the denser that gameObjects will be placed. The method is called only for the following levels of subdivision: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
- `altitude: double` Altitude of the face
- `steepness: double` The steepness of that coordinate. It is calculated by taking two other samples 4m away, one to the north, and one to the east, of which the maximum absolute difference between those heights and the base point height in meters is taken.
- `riverDistance: double`

```cpp
#define ADD_OBJECT(__addType__)                                                \
  types[addedCount++] = __addType__;                                           \
  if (addedCount >= BIOME_MAX_GAME_OBJECT_COUNT_PER_SUBDIVISION) {             \
    return addedCount;                                                         \
  }
```

Vanilla spawns different kinds of objects at different subdivision levels, look at the vanilla code for specifics.
