-- different types of animations are specified in common/animations, so the animations types can be assigned and used across all threads.
-- the list of keyframes here correspond with animation frames in the model file. So the moa model file contains a ~30 frame long animation, with each frame containing a unique pose.
-- Then those poses are named here, in the ordered keyframes enum below, and combined algorithmically in this lua module, for each animation specified in common/animations/moa.

-- proceduralType = 1 means that it will shuffle the keyframes. Without this, the animations are performed in the order given
-- for { keyframes.base, 0.4, {randomVariance = 0.4} }, the first parameter is the pose/keyframe, the second is the duration, and the third is a table of additional options
-- the engine will interpolate to the next key frame over the duration given.

-- additional options:
-- "randomVariance" is added to the base time. result = duration + randomFloatBetweenZeroAndOne * randomVariance
-- "trigger" calls a function every time that keyframe is hit, used for sounds and particle effects
-- "composites" can also be used here, to apply additional animations to individual specified bones over the top, eg. when a sapien waves while doing other things. See sapienCommon for an example
