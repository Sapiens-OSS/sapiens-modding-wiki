This opens the doors to additional bugs to sneak in! This section will explain some common issues and their solutions. Happy modding!</p><h2 id="debug-boolean" tabindex="-1">Debug Boolean <a class="header-anchor" href="#debug-boolean" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Debug Boolean&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Simply set <code>&quot;debug&quot;: true</code> at the top of the config file, and Hammerstone will print additional information about the object.</p><h2 id="problems" tabindex="-1">Problems <a class="header-anchor" href="#problems" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Problems&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A list of problems, and solutions</p><h3 id="buildable-doesn-t-start-building" tabindex="-1">Buildable Doesn&#39;t start Building <a class="header-anchor" href="#buildable-doesn-t-start-building" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Buildable Doesn&#39;t start Building&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If you notice that sapiens will gather the resources for a buildable but not start building it, this could be caused by the &quot;requirements&quot; being ill-matched.

For example the sequence created from <code>createStandardBuildSequence</code> doesn&#39;t work for buildables.</p><h3 id="object-crashes-when-i-click-on-it" tabindex="-1">Object Crashes when I Click On It <a class="header-anchor" href="#object-crashes-when-i-click-on-it" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Object Crashes when I Click On It&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Objects in Sapiens need the &quot;plans&quot; to be added.
