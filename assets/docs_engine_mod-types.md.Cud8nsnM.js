They need to be enabled per-world, and are only loaded when you load a world with them enabled. Typically, you will create a world mod.</p><p>Once a world is created, it&#39;s not possible to add or remove mods via the in-game UI. To get around this limitation, you can manually edit the <code>enabledMods</code> field inside of the worlds folder <code>config.xml</code>.</p><h2 id="app-mods" tabindex="-1">App Mods <a class="header-anchor" href="#app-mods" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;App Mods&quot;">​</a></h2><p>App mods are installed to the game&#39;s mods folder, and apply to all worlds as well as the home menu.</p><p>Because App Mods are <em>client side only</em>, they cannot access the server. This means that many mods are not possible with an app mod.</p><p>You should generally only create app mods when required. Localization mods are a good example.</p><h2 id="direct-editing" tabindex="-1">Direct Editing <a class="header-anchor" href="#direct-editing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Direct Editing&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Alongside officially supported mod types, you can also &#39;mod&#39; sapiens by editing the files in your installation folder. This is commonly used to quickly adjust constant values, like how often Sapiens have babies, or how quickly time passes.</p><p>Direct edits are a powerful tool for experimentation, and can also often be a good &#39;gateway drug&#39; to more sustainable modding techniques! With that said, they also come with some severe downsides:</p><ol><li>The edits are cleared everytime Sapiens is updated</li><li>Direct edits have a huge chance to break other mods, since they aren&#39;t following the system of shadows</li><li>Direct edits cannot easily be packaged up and shared with other people</li></ol>',13),i=[s];function l(n,r,p,c,h,m){return a(),o("div",null,i)}const f=e(d,[["render",l]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
